Joe Gatto, Salvatore Vulcano, Brian "Q" Quinn, and James "Murr" Murray hit comedy gold when they came up with the concept of being the Impractical Jokers—a quartet of friends where one person (with an earpiece) is put into an embarrassing candid camera situation, following the instructions of the other three until they can’t anymore. As their pranks turn real people into marks (with various degrees of patience) it’s like “Jackass” without the inevitability of an emergency room visit, the buddies all sharing big laughs behind monitors. And as much as the show has escalating budget sizes for the set-ups, nothing requires them to be exceptionally funny, just a little creative in their cruelty. You don’t get entirely skilled comedy from the Impractical Jokers, but you do get to see four guys who have turned forcefully messing with each other into a welcoming idea.
